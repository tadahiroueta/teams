INTRODUCTION

I am so damn proud of this one code. So let me tell you all about it.
Quarantine time. I wanted to sleep late, but my school had a pointless "tutor" class exclusively for announcements and taking role. So I wrote a program take role for me by saying "yes, miss" on the meeting chat at the right time. Later on, I implemented this to whole-year assemblies and even for my Spanish class.
It uses me ghetto method of scraping the text from the screen. It copy and pastes all text into text file in Notepad. It also uses pynput, because I love it.
